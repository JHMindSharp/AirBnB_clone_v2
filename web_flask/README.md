# Flask Web Application

This project involves the development of a simple Flask web application as part of the AirBnB clone project. The goal is to set up a web server with Flask to handle various web routes and display dynamic content.

## Description

The Flask web application includes the following functionalities:

- Serving dynamic content based on different URL paths.
- Utilizing HTML templates to render the content.
- Interfacing with a mock database to fetch and display data.
- Implementing application routing, HTTP methods, and request handling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask 1.1.x
- pycodestyle for linting
- A modern web browser

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JHMindSharp/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone_v2.git
cd <holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone_v2>
```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**

```

3. **Install Flask:**

If Flask is not installed, install it using pip:
